    "In the previous lecture, we saw that programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take (which part of code to execute) based on those conditions. Examples are:\n",
    "- In the Singapore Zoo case, the ticket price is conditionally determined by the age of the visitor. \n",
    "- In the leap year case, whether a year is a leap year or a common year is determined by a few conditions.\n",
