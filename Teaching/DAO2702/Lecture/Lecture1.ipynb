    "> *If you ask Python programmers what they like most about Python, they will often cite its high readability. Indeed, a high level of readability is at the heart of the design of the Python language, following the recognized fact that code is read much more often than it is written.* -  [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)\n",

    "#### Being \"Pythonic\"\n",
    "> *One reason for the high readability of Python code is its relatively complete set of Code Style guidelines and “Pythonic” idioms.*\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *When a veteran Python developer (a Pythonista) calls portions of code not “Pythonic”, they usually mean that these lines of code do not follow the common guidelines and fail to express its intent in what is considered the best (most readable) way.* - [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)\n",
