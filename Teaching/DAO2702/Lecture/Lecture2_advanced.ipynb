    "## Expected Kills in the PUBG Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Example 5**, we consider a PUBG type video game where totally $n$ players are killing each other until one player left to be the winner. If each player is equally good, we can show that the expected number of kills made by the winner is  $1+1/2+1/3+...+1/(n-1)$. Here is the proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $E(n-1)$ denote the expected kills made by the winner if there are totally $n-1$ players joining the game. If one additional player joins the game, there are totally $n$ players, then the expected kills $E(n)$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(n) = E(n-1)\\cdot (1-P_{n-1}) + (E(n-1) + 1)\\cdot P_{n-1} = E(n-1) + P_{n-1},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{n-1}$ is the probability that the additional player is killed by the winner. The equation above means that if the new player is killed by the winner, the number of kills made by the winner should be increased by one, otherwise, the number of kills remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because all players are equally good, we can derive that $P_{n-1} = 1/(n-1)$, since the new player is kill by the only winner among all $n-1$ players, thus $E(n) = E(n-1) + 1/(n-1) = E(n-2) + 1/(n-2) + 1/(n-1) = ... = E(2) + 1/2 + 1/(n-2) + 1/(n-1)$. Apparently, $E(2)=1$, because the number of kills is constantly one when there are only two players, so the expected kills is $1+1/2+1/3+...+1/(n-1)$.  "
