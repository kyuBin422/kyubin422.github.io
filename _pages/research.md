My research falls into the area: applied the stable matching into airline area to improve the crew members satisfaction.
In the crew assignment, the classic problem is crew pairing which is minimizing the crew operating cost. Intuitively, the cost of the employed junior crew is less than that of the senior crew and we assume they are meeting all conditions and constraints. Furthermore, fusing the crew preference into the crew pairing problem is the new trend. thus it is a new challenge for Air Operator Certificate (refer to AOC) holders how to schedule the crewâ€™s duty activity.
