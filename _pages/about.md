I am proficient at the network crawl. Such that inspect the network and crawl the target data and resources by selenium and requests. Furthermore, how to decrypt the javascript obfuscation function is necessary in some cases, and import the multiple proxies to speed and avoid being banned by the server.

In my daily life, I like to exercise, such as swimming and running. It is a good way to relax and keep my spirit  positive after research.
