affiliated research assistant with the [SIA-NUS Corp Lab](https://siacorplab.nus.edu.sg/). I specialize
in Stable Matching in Airline area. Luckily, I am being supervised by professor [Jussi Keppo](https://www.jussikeppo.com/). I earned my M.S. in
Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University *of* Massachusetts *at* Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) and my
